# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to the Amrita Placement Tracker!

## Code Style

- Function and variable names should be **camelCase**.

## Making Changes
1. **Fork** the repository (or clone if you have access).
2. Create a **feature branch**.
3. Ensure your code runs locally without errors.
4. Verify that existing features are not broken.

## Pull Request Process
1. Update the `README.md` with details of changes if applicable.
2. The PR content must match the branch name (e.g., fixing a bug or adding a feature).
3. Wait for at least one team member to review the code.
4. Resolve any conflicts before merging.

## Reporting Bugs
